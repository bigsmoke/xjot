XJot was intended to be a sparser representation of XML that requires less typing and squinting than regular XML. It's discontinued, because `bigsmoke` was reminded that there exists the `git diff --ignore-all-space` option. And, beyond the difficulty of diffing XML, let's not add the cognitive load of a special, sparse syntax to the already overly complex standard that XML is.
